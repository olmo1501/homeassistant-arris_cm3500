# Home Assistant Integration for Arris CM3500  

## About This Repository  
This integration allows you to monitor the status of your Arris CM3500 cable modem within Home Assistant. It tracks all available channels, including:  
- DOCSIS 3.0 (32 downstream / 8 upstream)  
- DOCSIS 3.1 (2 downstream / 2 upstream)  

You can disable channels that are not in use by your modem.  

### Why Monitor All Channels?  
If you experience connectivity issues due to problems with your CMTS or network infrastructure, you may lose certain downstream or upstream channels. This integration helps you track such behavior, making troubleshooting easier.  

I hope you find this integration useful!
