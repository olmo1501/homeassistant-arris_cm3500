# Arris CM3500 - Home Assistant Integration

## About this repo
I've developed this integration to monitor my Arris CM3500 Cable modem status.

I hope this integration will be helpful for you as well.

## Installation
I recommend installing it via [HACS](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

Currently, integration is not part of the HACS, so you will have to add the repository manually:
1. Go to HACS -> Integrations
2. Add this repo to your HACS custom repositories
3. Search for Arris CM3500 and Download it
4. Restart your HomeAssistant
